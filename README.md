## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model that predicts apartment prices in Mexico city using the features such as 'surface_covered_in_m2", "lat", "lon", "borough"

## Running the program
You can input 'python bikeshare.py' on your terminal to run this program. I use Anaconda's command prompt on a Windows 10 machine.

## Program Details
The projects runs by wrangling data and visualizing results while examining the real estate market in Mexico. In this project, analysis was done from descriptive to predictive data science. The major focus of the project was to create a machine learning model that predicts apartment prices in Mexico city.
This project looks into the following:
* Createing a linear regression model using the scikit-learn library.
* Building a data pipeline for imputing missing values and encoding categorical features.
* Improving model performance by reducing overfitting.
* Creating a dynamic dashboard for interacting with your completed model.

## Requirements
* Language: Python 3.6 or above
* Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn
